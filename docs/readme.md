<b>Course Description</b>: Project-based course in which students will use computational notebooks to perform exploratory data analyses and to test hypotheses in large neuroscience datasets, including the differences between unique neuron types, leveraging text mining of the neuroscience literature, and human neuroimaging analyses.

### Students will be able to:
* Write and edit Python code, particularly in Jupyter Notebooks
* Develop hypotheses specific to big data environments in neuroscience
* Design a big data experiment and excavate data from open sources
* Integrate data from multiple datasets to answer a biological question

## Grading
* In-class work & participation (20%): This is a small seminar, and we will be actively working through materials during lecture. You are expected to attend lectures.
* Assignments (45%): Weekly take-home assignments will support your progression through the course topics and will directly relate to the larger class projects. While most of these are problem sets, others are small writing assignments.
* Projects (35%). Includes the project proposal, code, and deliverables.
** The first project (15%) will ask you to investigate a specific cell type in the brain, combining information across electrophysiology, gene expression, visual responses, and activity. 
** In the second, slightly bigger project (20%) you’ll choose one brain region in humans and integrate three different datasets of your choosing to address the function of that brain region and identify possible links between genes, circuits, and behavior. 

Most assignments will be submitted through the DataHub (http://datahub.ucsd.edu). We will be using Canvas (http://canvas.ucsd.edu) to manage grades. Problem sets and projects will lose -10% for each day they are late.

Final scores will be converted to letter grades, where A=100-90%, B=89-80%, C=79-70%, D=69-60%, and F=59-0%. For positive and minus grades, A+ = 97-100, A = 93-96.99, A- = 90-92.99, B+ = 87-89.99, B = 83-86.99, B- = 80-82.99, and so on.

## Course Resources
There is no official textbook for this course. Instead, we’ll be relying on several online resources:
* Whirlwind Tour of Python: https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython/ 
* <a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/>Python Data Science Handbook</a> -- this book is available free online or in print.
* Neural Data Science: https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780128040430/neural-data-science

## Course Philosophy
### A note on our course’s environment
We’ll be working together to create an equitable and inclusive environment of mutual respect, in which we all feel comfortable to share our moments of confusion, ask questions, and challenge our understanding. Everyone should be able to succeed in this course. If you do not feel that is the case please let me know.

### Course accommodations
If you need accommodations for this course due to a disability, please contact the Office for Students with Disabilities (osd@ucsd.edu) for an Authorization for Accommodation letter. Please speak with me in the first week of class if you intend to apply for accommodations. For more information, visit http://disabilities.ucsd.edu. 

### This course, and the work it entails, is for you
So, you won’t benefit if others do your work. Cases of academic dishonesty or cheating will be first handled by me, and then by the Academic Integrity Office. If you become aware of cheating in this class, you can anonymously report it: https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/
